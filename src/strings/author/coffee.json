I've also linked many resources, but, if for whatever reason you wanted to talk to me, then we can setup a coffee chat where we can talk about anything you want. We can do resume reviews, mock interviews, whatever. \n\n I don't charge money for that kind of service because it's shitty to profit off of someone looking for help, but I am asking you to donate any amount you want to this charity: https://www.bluedragon.org/donate > Vietnam. \n\n Feel free to email me @ christopher.nguyn@gmail.com!"
